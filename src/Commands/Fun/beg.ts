	 * Execute the !beg command. This command allows users to beg for free coins every 12 hours.
	 * The command will check if the user has already begged in the last 12 hours and if the stream is currently live.
	 * If the user has not begged in the last 12 hours and the stream is live, the command will randomly decide
	 * if the user is successful in their beg. If the user is successful, they will receive a random amount of coins
	 * between 1 and 100. If the user is not successful, they will receive a random response from a list of failed responses.
	 * If the user has already begged in the last 12 hours, the command will respond with a cooldown message.
	 * @param channel - The channel where the command was triggered
	 * @param user - The user who triggered the command
	 * @param args - The arguments passed to the command
	 * @param text - The text that the user typed in to trigger the command
